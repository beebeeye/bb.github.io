<h1>Description</h1>
<p class="content">Develop the program based on the owner's requirements.  </p>
<p class="content">>Design codes: The program covers "economic requirements" such as architecture density, floor area ratio (=total floor area of buildings on a site divided by total site area), area, number of levels, functions, etc. </p><br><br>
<h1>Why Pain?</h1><span class="content">The pain is due to the lack of standards for owners' requirement documents, and the owners' lack of architecture professional background. Not all owners have a clear idea of what they want and what's possible. Requirements from owner’s lack of architecture background are sometimes lack of details, unreasonable, or impossible. It takes a lot of communication to clarify requirements and develop the program.</span>
<br><br>
<h1>Workarounds</h1><span class="content">The only support from technology that the participants could think of, to resolve the pain is a document template for program.</span>
